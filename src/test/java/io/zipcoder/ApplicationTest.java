 * Create a program that:
 * - asks the user how many pets they have
 * - ask them what kind of pet each one is
 * --- how many dogs? how many cats? how many rabbits? etc.
 * - along with each pet's name.
 * - For now your program should just hold onto the user input and print out the list at the end;
